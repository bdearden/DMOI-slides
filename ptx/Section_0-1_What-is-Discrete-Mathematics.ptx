        Whatever your conception of what mathematics is,
        try applying the concept of <q>discrete</q> to it, as defined above.
        Some math fundamentally deals with <em>stuff</em>
        that is individually separate and distinct.

            The most popular mathematician in the world is throwing a party for all of his friends.
            As a way to kick things off, they decide that everyone should shake hands.
            Assuming all 10 people at the party each shake hands with every other person
            (but not themselves,
            obviously)
            exactly once, how many handshakes take place?

            At the warm-up event for Oscar's All Star Hot Dog Eating Contest, Al ate one hot dog.
            Bob then showed him up by eating three hot dogs.
            Not to be outdone, Carl ate five.
            This continued with each contestant eating two more hot dogs than the previous contestant.
            How many hot dogs did Zeno (the 26th and final contestant) eat?
            How many hot dogs were eaten all together?

            Back in the days of yore,
            five small towns decided they wanted to build roads directly connecting each pair of towns.
            While the towns had plenty of money to build roads as long and as winding as they wished,
            it was very important that the roads not intersect
            with each other
            (as stop signs had not yet been invented).
            Also, tunnels and bridges were not allowed.
            Is it possible for each of these towns to build a road to each of the four other towns without creating any intersections?

      <title>Summary</title>
      <p>
        Each of the problems above illustrate one of the main topics we will discuss in this course. 
        <ul pause="yes">

            <p>
              Discrete mathematics deals with counting <em>how many</em> ways something can happen.  We will learn how to count in chapter 1.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Discrete mathematics deals with manipulating sequences of numbers.  We will investigate this in chapter 2.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Discrete mathematics deals with logic, which also helps us understand how to prove our solutions to problems are correct.  We will do both of these in chapter 3.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Discrete mathematics deals with the ways things can be <em>related</em>.  These relationships can be modeled using <em>graphs</em>, which we will study in chapter 4.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p pause="yes">
        But first, we will review some basic mathematical tools that will help us study these questions.
