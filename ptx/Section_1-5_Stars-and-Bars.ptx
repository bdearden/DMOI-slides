        Suppose you have some number of identical Rubik's cubes to distribute to your friends.
        Imagine you start with a single row of the cubes.

          Your favorite mathematical ice-cream parlor offers 10 flavors.
          How many milkshakes could you create using exactly 6, not necessarily distinct scoops?
          The order you add the flavors does not matter (they will be blended up anyway) but you are allowed repeats.
          So one possible shake is triple chocolate, double cherry,
          and mint chocolate chip.
