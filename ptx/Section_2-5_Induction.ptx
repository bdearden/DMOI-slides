        You need to mail a package, but don't yet know how much postage you will need.
        You have a large supply of 8-cent stamps and 5-cent stamps.
        Which amounts of postage can you make exactly using these stamps?
        Which amounts are impossible to make?

        Start by saying what the statement is that you want to prove: <q>Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement<ellipsis/></q> To prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>, you must prove two facts:

        <ol permid="zcP"><li permid="DMI">
            <p permid="oDK">
              Base case: Prove that <m>P(0)</m> is true.
              You do this directly.
              This is often easy.
            </p>
          </li><li permid="jTR">
            <p permid="UKT">
              Inductive case: Prove that
              <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m> for all <m>k \ge 0</m>.
              That is, prove that for any <m>k \ge 0</m> if <m>P(k)</m> is true,
              then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true as well.
              This is the proof of an if
              <ellipsis/> then
              <ellipsis/> statement,
              so you can assume <m>P(k)</m> is true (<m>P(k)</m> is called the
              <em>inductive hypothesis</em>).
                <idx><h>inductive hypothesis</h></idx>
            You must then explain why <m>P(k+1)</m> is also true, given that assumption.

          <p permid="Drj">
        Start with a square piece of paper.
        You want to cut this square into smaller squares, leaving no waste
        (every piece of paper you end up with must be a square).
        Obviously it is possible to cut the square into 4 squares.
        You can also cut it into 9 squares.
        It turns out you can cut the square into 7 squares
        (although not all the same size).
        What other numbers of squares could you end up with?
