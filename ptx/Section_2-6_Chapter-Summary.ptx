        Each day your supply of magic chocolate covered espresso beans doubles
        (each one splits in half),
        but then you eat 5 of them.
        You have 10 at the start of day 0.

            <p permid="tJc">
              Write out the first few terms of the sequence.
              Then give a recursive definition for the sequence and explain how you know it is correct.

              Prove, using induction,
              that the last digit of the number of beans you have on the <m>n</m>th day is always a 5 for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

              Find a closed formula for the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence and prove it is correct by induction.
