    <title>Planar Graphs</title>

        When a connected graph can be drawn without any edges crossing,
        it is called <term>planar</term>.
        When a planar graph is drawn in this way,
        it divides the plane into regions called <term>faces</term>.

              Draw, if possible,
              two different planar graphs with the same number of vertices, edges,

        A cube

        is an example of a convex polyhedron.
        It contains 6 identical squares for its faces, 8 vertices,
        and 12 edges.
        The cube is a <term>regular polyhedron</term>
        (also known as a <term>Platonic solid</term>)
            <idx><h>Platonic solid</h></idx>
        because each face is an identical regular polygon and each vertex joins an equal number of faces.

        There are exactly four other regular polyhedra:
        the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron,
        and icosahedron with 4, 8, 12 and 20 faces respectively.
        How many vertices and edges do each of these have?
