        You have a bunch of chips which come in five different colors:
        red, blue, green, purple and yellow.

              How many different two-chip stacks can you make if the bottom chip must be red or blue?

      A <term>permutation</term> is a (possible) rearrangement of objects.
      For example,
      there are 6 permutations of the letters <em>a, b, c</em>:
        <me permid="BkB">
        abc, ~~ acb, ~~ bac, ~~bca, ~~ cab, ~~ cba
        </me>.

      <p pause="yes">
      We know that we have them all: there are 3 choices for which letter we put first, then 2 choices for which letter comes next,
      which leaves only 1 choice for the last letter.
      The multiplicative principle says we multiply <m>3\cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.

      We write this number <m>P(n,k)</m> and sometimes call it a
        <term>
          <m>k</m>-permutation of <m>n</m> elements</term>.
      To compute <m>P(n,k)</m> we must apply the multiplicative principle to <m>k</m> numbers,
      starting with <m>n</m> and counting backwards.
      For example
        <me permid="NyT">
        P(10, 4) = 10\cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7

        <m>P(n,k)</m> is the number of <term><m>k</m>-permutations of <m>n</m> elements</term>,
        the number of ways to <em>arrange</em>
        <m>k</m> objects chosen from <m>n</m> distinct objects.
        <me permid="knQ">

      <p permid="Qtz">
      Another way to find the number of <m>k</m>-permutations of <m>n</m> elements:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            First <em>choose</em> which <m>k</m> elements will be in the permutation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Then arrange them (permute them).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Using the multiplicative principle,
      we get another formula for <m>P(n,k)</m>:
        <me permid="FUu">
        P(n,k) = {n \choose k}\cdot k!

        Divide by <m>k!</m> to get a formula for <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>.
