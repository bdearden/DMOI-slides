        Suppose you have some number of identical Rubik's cubes to distribute to your friends.
        Imagine you start with a single row of the cubes.

        You have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids.
        How many ways can you do this?

      <p pause="yes">
      Take a moment to think about how you might solve this problem.
      You may assume that it is acceptable to give a kid no cookies.
      Also, the cookies are all identical and the order in which you give out the cookies does not matter.

      <title>Counting with Functions</title>
      <p>
        How is distributing 7 cookies to 4 kids like a function?
      </p>
      <p pause="yes">
        The number of functions
        <m>f: \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\} \to \{a,b,c,d\}</m>
        is <m>4^7 = 16384</m>.
        </p>
        <p pause="yes">
        The number of
        ways to assign 7 cookies to 4 kids is
        <m>{10 \choose 3} = 120</m>.
        What is going on here?
      </p>
      <p pause="yes">
        When we count functions,
        we consider the following two functions to be different:
        <me permid="RWe">
          f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4\amp 5 \amp 6 \amp 7}{a \amp b \amp c \amp c \amp c \amp c \amp c} \qquad g = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4\amp 5 \amp 6 \amp 7}{b \amp a \amp c \amp c \amp c \amp c \amp c}
        </me>.
        But these two functions would correspond to the
        <em>same</em>
        cookie distribution.
